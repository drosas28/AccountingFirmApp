## This repository contains a web application for an accounting office(firm). 
The main features include offering general accounting services, maintaining direct contact with frequent clients, and utilizing a calendar to schedule visits to business clients.

This web application was developed as part of the Web Applications course. It was a collaborative team project, and I contributed to both the design and development. While the code is hosted on this account, the project reflects shared efforts.
